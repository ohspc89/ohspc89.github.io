I design and maintain data pipelines for large-scale wearable sensor data in human movement research.

My work bridges domain knowledge in motor control with scalable data engineering practices, including structured ETL workflows, automated quality control systems, and reproducible research infrastructure.

I have developed end-to-end processing systems for infant movement datasets, integrating data validation, incremental QC, and modular processing pipelines in Python and R.

My long-term goal is to build robust, production-grade data systems that enable reliable analysis of complex human behavioral data in both research and applied settings.

## Selected Projects

### Infant Wearable ETL Pipeline
Designed a modular processing pipeline for large-scale IMU datasets, including structured ingestion, preprocessing, and feature extraction.

### Incremental QC Automation System
Implemented a diff-based quality control framework in R with automated reporting and per-coder error tracking.

### HBCD Motion Post-Processing Toolkit
Developed a reproducible post-processing toolkit for wearable sensor data, containerized with Docker for cross-environment consistency.

### ELAN Behavioral Coding QC Pipeline
Built an R-based ETL and validation system for structured behavioral annotation files.
